  <p class="narration">Before you stands a man with shoulder-length curly brown hair. He is casually dressed, holding a pair of glasses, and you spy the notable bulk of a telepresence unit strapped to his forearm. As he speaks, the holographic image flickers as it reroutes around some network congestion.</p>
  <blockquote>"I am Payton Swick. You have done well to find me. Now, what is that you wish to know?"</blockquote>
  <p class="narration">A set of glowing icons appears in the air before you.</p>

    <blockquote>"About me? Ah yes, well, I write code for [Automattic](https://automattic.com), and also for myself. You can see some of it on [GitHub](https://github.com/sirbrillig)."</blockquote>
    <p class="narration">The hologram turns and looks at something you can't see.</p>
    <blockquote>"Oh, and I blog a bit. There's some ramblings about [tea](http://someteawith.me), and also [my writings on code and life](https://payton.codes) that you may find interesting."</blockquote>
